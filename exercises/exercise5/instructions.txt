In this exercise, you will use generics to allow Stack instances to specify what type of data they can contain.

1. In the file stack.ts, add a T type parameter to the class.  Be sure to put the type parameter in all the necessary locations to ensure type safety.

2. For the stack variable, specify the type Printable as the type parameter.

3. Compile and run the code.  Make sure there are no errors and the output is as expected.

4. Change the type parameter to number and compile the code.  There will be an error because the stack only accepts strings, not numbers.

5. Comment out the line that pushes the string onto the stack, and then repeat step 3.
