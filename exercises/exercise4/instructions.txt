In this exercise, you will change the Stack class to accept any object that can be converted to a string.

1. Create an interface called Printable that contains one method, toString(), accepting no parameters and returning string.

2. Change the Stack class so it references the Printable interface instead of type number.

3. After the code to push the numbers onto the stack, add code to push the string "Tim" onto the stack.

4. Compile and run the code.  Make sure there are no errors and the output is as expected.  Observe that the stack can now hold any type with a toString() method.
