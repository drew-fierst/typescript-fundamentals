In this exercise you will add to the previous solution, creating an array of numbers 
for use in future exercises and adding type annotations to your code.

1. In myGreeting.ts, create an array called _elements that stores only elements of type number.
	You will use it to create a number stack in future exercises.

2. Assign an array with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to _elements, and print the array contents to the console.

3. Add type annotations to your code wherever possible for maximum type safety.

4. Compile your code and run it.  Make sure there are no errors and the output is as expected.
