In this exercise, you will create a simple class to store and manipulate a stack data structure containing numbers.

1. In the file stack.ts, create a class called Stack that encapsulates the _elements array as a stack of numbers.

The class should contain:
* The _elements array, marked private or protected.
* push() and pop() methods to call the corresponding methods of the array
* a getSize() method that returns the length of the array
* a toString() method that concatenates the elements in order from top to bottom (be sure elements are in the correct order!).

5. Create a new stack and put it into a variable called s.  Push the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in order, into the stack.

6. Print the result of the stack's toString() method to the console.

7. Compile and run the code. make sure there are no errors and the output is as expected.
