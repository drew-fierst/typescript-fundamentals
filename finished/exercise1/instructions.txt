In this exercise we will set up TypeScript via npm (part of node.js) and test the installation by writing a very simple program.

1. Install node.js, if it is not already installed, by downloading it from www.nodejs.org.

* Make sure node.js is in your path so you can run it from anywhere.

2. Open a command prompt and type the following to install TypeScript:
npm install -g typescript

3. In the file myGreeting.ts, write code to do the following:

* Use 'let' to declare a variable containing your first name.
* Write an arrow function that accepts a first name as a parameter and returns a template string with a greeting containing the parameter.  Store it in the variable 'greeter' using the 'let' command.
* Use 'console.log' to call and print the return value of the greeter function with your name as parameter.

4. Open a command prompt and run the following command to compile your program:
tsc myGreeting.ts

4. If there are any compiler errors, go back and fix them.  Otherwise, enter the following command to run your program:
node myGreeting.js

* Be sure to correct any runtime errors and make sure the output is what you would expect.

5. Compare the original myGreeting.ts and the compiled myGreeting.js, and notice the similarities and differences.
